## Introduction
﻿﻿﻿This room will cover all of the basics of attacking Kerberos the windows ticket-granting service; we'll cover the following:  
- Initial enumeration using tools like Kerbrute and Rubeus
- Kerberoasting
- AS-REP Roasting with Rubeus and Impacket
- Golden/Silver Ticket Attacks
- Pass the Ticket
- Skeleton key attacks using mimikatz
This room will be related to very real-world applications and will most likely not help with any CTFs however it will give you great starting knowledge of how to escalate your privileges to a domain admin by attacking Kerberos and allow you to take over and control a network.  
It is recommended to have knowledge of general post-exploitation, active directory basics, and windows command line to be successful with this room.
