## Introduction
Cyber security careers are becoming more in demand and offer [high salaries](https://tryhackme.com/resources/blog/cyber-security-salary-career-options).There are many different jobs within the security industry, from offensive pentesting (hacking machines and reporting on vulnerabilities) to defensive security (defending against and investigating cyberattacks).
Why get a career in cyber:  
- High Pay - jobs in security have high starting salaries
- Exciting - work can include legally hacking systems or defending against cyber attacks
- Be in demand - there are over 3.5 million unfilled cyber positions

This room helps you break into cyber security by providing information about various cyber security roles; it also links to different learning paths that you can use to start building your cyber skills.


## Security Analyst
Security analysts are integral to constructing security measures across organisations to protect the company from attacks. Analysts explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop preventative measures. This job role requires working with various stakeholders to gain an understanding of security requirements and the security landscape.
### Responsibilities
- Working with various stakeholders to analyse the cyber security throughout the company
- Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks, documenting security issues and measures taken in response
- Develop security plans, incorporating research on new attack tools and trends, and measures needed across teams to maintain data security.


## Security Engineer
Security engineers develop and implement security solutions using threats and vulnerability data - often sourced from members of the security workforce. Security engineers work across circumventing a breadth of attacks, including web application attacks, network threats, and evolving trends and tactics. The ultimate goal is to retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risk of attack and data loss.
### Responsibilities
- Testing and screening security measures across software
- Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities
- Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security

## Incident Responder
Incident responders respond productively and efficiently to security breaches. Responsibilities include creating plans, policies, and protocols for organisations to enact during and following incidents. This is often a highly pressurised position with assessments and responses required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding. Incident response metrics include MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR - the meantime to detect, acknowledge, and recover (from attacks.) The aim is to achieve a swift and effective response, retain financial standing and avoid negative breach implications. Ultimately, incident responders protect the company's data, reputation, and financial standing from cyber attacks.
### Responsibilities
- Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
- Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
- Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents
