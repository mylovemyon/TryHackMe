## Introduction
We will continue our journey exploring the Windows operating system.  
To summarize the previous two rooms:
- In Windows Fundamentals 1, we covered the desktop, the file system, user account control, the control panel, settings, and the task manager.
- In Windows Fundamentals 2, we covered various utilities, such as System Configuration, Computer Management, Resource Monitor, etc.

This module will attempt to provide an overview of the security features within the Windows operating system.


## Windows Updates
Let's start things off with Windows Update.  
Windows Update is a service provided by Microsoft to provide security updates, feature enhancements, and patches for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Defender.  
Updates are typically released on the 2nd Tuesday of each month. This day is called Patch Tuesday. That doesn't necessarily mean that a critical update/patch has to wait for the next Patch Tuesday to be released. If the update is urgent, then Microsoft will push the update via the Windows Update service to the Windows devices.

Refer to the following link to see the Microsoft Security Update Guide here.  

Windows Update is located in Settings. See below.

Tip: Another way to access Windows Update is from the Run dialog box, or CMD, by running the command control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate.
